            <div class="article-content text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p>When applying for apartments there is an expectation that you are going to give up a certain level of sensitive information. This will likely be at least a government issued ID, paystubs, rental history, date of birth, etc. However, either due to mission creep or for legitimate business purposes, there has been an increase in the invasiveness of requests for sensitive personal information from property management companies and their affiliates. This may include biometric information like face or fingerprint scans (ostensibly to validate IDs), or increased access to information which was provided at more of a summary level historically (requiring direct access to banking information rather than paystub snapshots). I wish to discuss the latter example.
</p>
                <h2 class="text-sm font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight">The Background</h2>
                <p>I was applying for an apartment in my city and during the application process I entered the personal information they requested. After I paid both the application and administrative fees I received an email saying that I would need to verify my income with pay stubs. However I was unpleasantly surprised when a company called Payscore requested the login credentials to my bank. It wasn’t redirecting me to my bank’s website, it was directly requesting that I input them into the website of Payscore. This is an issue for several reasons, the first being that there is an inherent risk in providing that level of information to anyone. Your credentials could get leaked, your information could (and likely will) be sold to advertisers/data brokers, and the bank could shield it’s liability from these risks. But beyond that, there are greater principles at play.</p>
                <p>Although similar at first glance this behavior is distinct from how companies like Plaid operate when helping you connect banking information to third party services. Directly from Plaid’s support they clarify that “you will be redirected to your financial institution’s website where you can directly input your login credentials. After that, your financial institution will provide Plaid with access through a secure token.” This means that Plaid doesn’t actually have direct access to you login information. But why is this important? I’ll start by directly quoting to excerpts from the privacy policies of two of the larger banks in the world, Bank of America & Wells Fargo.</p>
                <p class= "font-semibold">Bank of America’s privacy notice:</p> 
                <p>We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any personal information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your site user ID and password.</p>
                <p class= "font-semibold">From section 18 of Wells Fargo’s online access agreement:</p> 
<p>“You are responsible for actions taken by anyone using the Service after signing in with your username and password, or any other Wells Fargo approved authentication control, except as 
otherwise provided by law or regulation. We are entitled to rely and act upon instructions received under your username and password.”</p>
                <p>This means providing the username and password directly to Payscore versus a secure token like through Plaid, could allow your bank to insulate itself from any of the associated risks with sharing this information. It also means, as implied by Wells Fargo’s last sentence, that the level of risk is not only that they can take money from you, but from your bank’s perspective they <em>are you</em>.</p>
                <h2 class="text-sm font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>It is not only the flagrant privacy issues (how do you know your information is being stored securely or not being sold to advertisers/data brokers), but also the fact that landlords know that your options are limited in fighting against this. You can choose go to a different complex, and hopefully they are not owned by the same property management company or operating under similar practices. They won’t tell you in advance that they collect this information as it is requested after you pay for the various application fees, so you will need to confirm each time. If someone who lives paycheck to paycheck (70% of people according to a Forbes survey) has applied and already forked up the application and administrative charges, then that can force their hand to stick with the apartment and oblige the privacy infringements. These companies rely on either your options being limited or you not understanding the concessions you make by giving them more and more access. Similarly to many other shady corporate practices, they shield these key facts in legalize and lengthy forms, or simply by withholding the information until you can do little about it. These terms must be explained clearly to everyone and there must be recourse for the tenant. Without this there is no limit to the overreach.</p>
